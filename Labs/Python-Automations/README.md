# ‚öôÔ∏è Blue Team Automation

This folder contains my **Python-based automation projects** focused on Blue Team and SOC operations.

Each script here solves a real defensive problem ‚Äî from IOC enrichment to log triage and network data analysis.  
These tools are designed to be **simple, fast, and reusable** in any lab or detection workflow.

## üß© Included Tools
- `ioc_enricher.py` ‚Äî Enriches IPs/domains/hashes using VirusTotal & AbuseIPDB APIs.  
- `failed_login_triage.py` ‚Äî Detects brute-force login attempts from Windows event logs.  
- `zeek_conn_summary.py` ‚Äî Summarizes Zeek connection logs for quick network triage.

## üß† Purpose
The goal of this toolkit is to:
- Automate repetitive SOC tasks  
- Speed up IOC and log analysis  
- Learn Python for practical cybersecurity use cases  

Each tool includes inline comments and example usage for self-learning and adaptation.
