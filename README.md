# Bobo Nikolov — Cybersecurity Portfolio  
**Aspiring SOC Analyst | Ethical Hacking | Threat Detection | Security Engineering | Incident Response | Security Tool Development**

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.  
This repository documents practical security projects, defensive tooling, as well as offensive validating and research focused on detection engineering, Windows security, and realistic attack-path analysis.

My work centers on understanding how real incidents occur in enterprise environments and how defenders detect, investigate, and respond using actual telemetry rather than artificial scenarios.

## Projects

This portfolio includes several security-focused tools and research projects:

### EchoPentest Toolkit
A growing set of security tools focused on practical defensive visibility and assessment:

- **EchoExposure**  
  External attack surface monitoring and domain exposure analysis.

- **EchoVuln**  
  Endpoint vulnerability visibility and prioritization with agent-based snapshots.

- **EchoPhishing (in development)**  
  Email threat detection and phishing analysis platform designed for small and mid-size environments.

These tools are designed with usability, automation, and realistic threat modeling in mind, with the long-term goal of supporting small and medium organizations that lack dedicated security teams.

### Security Research & Development Projects

- **AI Phishing Analyzer Prototype**  
  Machine learning approach to phishing detection and classification.

- **AI Digital Footprint Mapper**  
  Automated OSINT and exposure mapping tool.

- **Incident Response Playbook Generator**  
  Tool for generating structured incident response workflows.

- **Malware Sandbox Project**  
  Controlled environment for analyzing suspicious binaries and behavior.

- **PurpleOps Playground**  
  Environment for simulating attacker and defender workflows.

- **Attack-Defend Lab**  
  Practical experiments in detection, telemetry, and response.

- **SMB Security Series**  
  A multi-phase defensive case study focused on credential exposure, lateral movement detection, remediation, and validation.

## About This Portfolio

This portfolio is built to demonstrate:

- Practical detection engineering
- Security tooling and automation
- Incident investigation methodology
- Realistic lab environments and attack simulations
- Continuous improvement and research

The focus is on clarity, realism, and technical depth rather than volume of tools or theoretical coverage.
