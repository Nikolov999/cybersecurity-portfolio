# Mitigation Verification



### Objective



Confirm remediation controls block or limit attack impact.

# Mitigation Controls Tested



---



## 1. Account Lockout



Configuration:

- 5 attempts

- 15 minute lockout



Observed:

- Account locked after threshold

- Event 4740 generated

- Attack halted



Status:

Effective



---



## 2. Network Level Authentication



Observed:

- Authentication required before session creation

- No full session without valid credentials



Status:

Effective



---



## 3. Firewall Restriction



Configured:

- RDP allowed only from management IP



Observed:

- Non-allowed VM connection refused

- No 4624 generated



Status:

Effective



---



## 4. TLS Enforcement



Verified:

- SecurityLayer = 2

- SSL enforced



Status:

Secure channel confirmed



---



## 5. Admin Account Renaming



Observed:

- Default “Administrator” not usable

- Brute automation attempts failed



Status:

Reduced automated attack surface



---



# Residual Risk



Remaining risks:



- Credential theft outside RDP

- Insider misuse

- Compromised management workstation



Mitigations reduced remote brute viability significantly.



---



# Mitigation Effectiveness



Before:

Unlimited attempts  

Open exposure  



After:

Rate-limited  

Account lockout enforced  

IP-restricted  

Monitored  

Correlated  



Security posture measurably improved.
