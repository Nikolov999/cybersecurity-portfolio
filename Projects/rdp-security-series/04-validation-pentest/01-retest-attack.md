# Retest Attack



### Objective



Validate that previously identified RDP weaknesses are now:



- Detectable

- Rate-limited

- Account-lockout enforced

- Properly correlated

- Risk-scored accurately

# Test Environment



Attacker:

- Kali Linux VM



Target:

- Windows 8/10 VM (Bridged)



Monitoring:

- EchoSentinel (Host)

# Retest Scenarios Executed



---



## 1. RDP Brute Force (Single User)



Tool:

Hydra



Command:

hydra -l testuser -P rockyou.txt rdp://192.168.1.35



Expected:

- Account lockout after 5 attempts

- ES-AUTH-003 triggered

- Suppression applied after first alert



Observed:

- 4625 events generated

- Lockout event 4740 triggered

- ES-AUTH-003 alert created

- Risk score elevated due to recurrence



Result:

Detection successful  

Mitigation effective

## 2. Password Spray (Multiple Users)



Method:

Multiple usernames, 1 password



Expected:

- ES-AUTH-002 triggered

- High severity

- MITRE T1110



Observed:

- Distinct username threshold met

- High severity alert generated

- Risk score > 80 on server asset



Result:

Detection confirmed  



---



## 3. Brute → Successful Login



Method:

Intentional correct password after failures



Expected:

- ES-CORR-001 triggered

- High severity correlation alert



Observed:

- 5x 4625 followed by 4624

- Correlation ID generated

- MITRE T1110 mapped

- Risk elevated with recurrence boost



Result:

Compromise pattern detected correctly  



---



## 4. Privileged RDP Login



Method:

Admin RDP session



Expected:

- ES-AUTH-005 triggered



Observed:

- LogonType=10

- Privileged user detection triggered

- Medium severity

- Risk adjusted based on asset criticality



Result:

Privileged access monitored

# Retest Conclusion



All attack vectors previously tested were:



- Detectable

- Correlated

- Risk-scored

- Logged

- Visible in EchoSentinel dashboard



Detection coverage confirmed post-hardening.
