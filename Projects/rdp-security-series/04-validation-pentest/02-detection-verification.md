\## Event Visibility



Confirmed ingestion of:



\- 4624 – Successful logon

\- 4625 – Failed logon

\- 4648 – Explicit credentials

\- 4672 – Special privileges

\- 4740 – Account lockout



All visible in events table.

\## Rule Trigger Validation



| Rule | Triggered | Correct Severity |

|------|-----------|-----------------|

| ES-AUTH-001 | Yes | Medium |

| ES-AUTH-002 | Yes | High |

| ES-AUTH-003 | Yes | High |

| ES-AUTH-004 | Yes | Medium |

| ES-AUTH-005 | Yes | Medium |

| ES-AUTH-006 | Yes | Low/Medium |

| ES-CORR-001 | Yes | High |



All rules behaved deterministically.

\## Correlation Verification



Brute → Success pattern:



\- Confirmed 4625 burst

\- Followed by 4624

\- Single correlation alert created

\- Duplicate alerts suppressed



Correlation logic functioning correctly.



---



\## Suppression Logic



Severity-based suppression prevented:



\- Alert flooding

\- Duplicate RDP brute alerts

\- Excess noise during testing



Suppression window confirmed working.

\## Risk Scoring Verification



Risk influenced by:



\- Severity score

\- Asset criticality

\- Privileged user

\- First-seen anomaly

\- Recurrence factor



Observed:



\- Lab workstation brute = medium risk

\- Server brute = high risk

\- Correlated compromise = critical range



Scoring model behaving as designed.

\# Detection Confidence Level



High



Detections are:



\- Deterministic

\- Explainable

\- MITRE-aligned

\- Low-noise after tuning
