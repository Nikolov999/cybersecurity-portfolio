\# RDP Security Series – 02 Remediation



This module documents defensive controls implemented after conducting offensive RDP simulations.



It focuses on:



\- Hardening authentication mechanisms

\- Restricting access scope

\- Enforcing encryption standards

\- Implementing least privilege

\- Improving detection telemetry
