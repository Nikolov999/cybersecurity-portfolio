### Analysis – Fake Persistence Simulation

## 1. Overview
**Script:** `fake_persistence_sim.ps1`  
**Behaviour simulated:**  
- Creating a folder under `C:\Sandbox\bin`
- Creating a harmless placeholder executable
- Writing a registry value under:
  `HKCU:\Software\SandboxDemo\PersistenceDemo`

**Purpose:**  
To emulate persistence-like behaviour (registry modification + file creation) in a SAFE, controlled way.  
*No actual startup keys (Run/RunOnce) were modified.*
