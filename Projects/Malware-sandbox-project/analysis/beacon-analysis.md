# Analysis – Fake Beacon Simulation

## 1. Overview
**Script:** `fake_beacon_sim.py`  
**Simulated behaviour:**  
- Long-running Python process  
- Writes a timestamped “BEACON” line to a log file every 10 seconds  
- No network traffic (fully local and safe)

**Purpose:**  
To simulate beacon-like periodic activity that resembles command-and-control (C2) malware patterns, but using harmless file writes instead of real networking.
