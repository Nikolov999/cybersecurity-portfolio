#  Projects Overview

Welcome to the **Projects** section of my Blue & Purple Team portfolio.

Each project here is a self-contained lab designed to simulate real-world cyber operations — from **reconnaissance and exploitation** to **detection and response** — with all activity captured, documented, and analyzed using **open-source tools** like Wazuh, Wireshark, and Security Onion.

##  Completed Projects

### **Attack-Defend Lab**
An isolated Kali ↔ Ubuntu environment demonstrating exploitation, persistence, and privilege escalation, with future integration of Security Onion for defensive telemetry.

**Highlights:**
- Red & Blue team coverage of MITRE ATT&CK phases  
- Privilege escalation & persistence techniques  
- Documentation and packet analysis evidence

##  In Progress

### **PurpleOps Playground**
Full adversary simulation designed to exercise both attacker tactics and defender analysis in one environment.

**Current Scope:**
- SQL Injection, Brute Force, and HTTP exploitation  
- Privilege escalation and controlled file exfiltration  
- Detection and correlation through **Wazuh** and **Wireshark**

##  Tools Commonly Used
- **Wazuh** (SIEM / EDR visibility)
- **Wireshark** (network packet analysis)
- **Kali Linux** (attacker simulation)
- **Ubuntu Server** (victim environment)
- **MITRE ATT&CK** mapping for phase tracking

> 💬 *Each lab reflects my practical understanding of offensive and defensive security concepts — from detection engineering to incident response — with all data safely executed in isolated virtual environments.*
