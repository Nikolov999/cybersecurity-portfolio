# 03  Mitigation Verification

## Objective
Prove cleanup worked and persistence is removed.

## Steps (after evidence captured)
1. Delete task:
   - schtasks /delete /tn "WindowsUpdateCheck" /f
2. Remove payload:
   - del /f /q C:\Users\Public\updater.ps1
3. Confirm task file removed:
   - Check absence of `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\WindowsUpdateCheck`
4. Confirm no further `schtasks /run` executions occur
5. Confirm EchoSentinel shows no new hits after cleanup

## Evidence
- Screenshot: task no longer listed (schtasks /query failure or absence)
- Screenshot: EchoSentinel shows no new related events after cleanup window
