# \# Residual Risks — SMB Credential Abuse Scenario

# 

# \## Overview

# While remediation and detection controls significantly reduced risk,

# certain attack possibilities remain inherent to Windows environments

# and credential-based access models.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Residual Risks

# 

# \### 1. Legitimate Credential Abuse

# If valid administrative credentials are used:

# \- Authentication events may appear legitimate

# \- Detection relies on behavioral context rather than signature-based alerts

# 

# This is an inherent limitation of identity-based systems.

# 

# ---

# 

# \### 2. Noise in Network Logons

# Network logon events (LogonType 3) are common in Windows environments.

# Although detection was refined, some benign activity may still appear

# similar without additional context.

# 

# ---

# 

# \### 3. Alternative Execution Methods

# Attackers may:

# \- Use non-service-based execution techniques

# \- Avoid common service names or execution artifacts

# 

# Detection coverage is strongest for known execution patterns.

# 

# ---

# 

# \### 4. Client-Side Visibility Gaps

# Windows Home and minimally-instrumented clients provide limited telemetry:

# \- SMB share access on the client side may not be logged

# \- Detection relies primarily on server-side evidence

# 

# This reduces early-stage visibility.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Risk Acceptance Statement

# 

# Residual risk is accepted at this stage because:

# \- Credential exposure has been remediated

# \- High-impact abuse produces detectable signals

# \- The remaining risks require advanced adversary tradecraft

# 

# Further reduction would require:

# \- Endpoint instrumentation (e.g. Sysmon)

# \- Domain-based identity controls

# \- Advanced correlation across hosts

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Conclusion

# 

# The remaining risks are consistent with real-world enterprise environments

# and do not undermine the effectiveness of the controls implemented in this lab series.
