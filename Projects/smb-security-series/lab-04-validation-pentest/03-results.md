# \# Lab 4 — Results

# 

# \## Objective

# Validate that remediation and detection engineering applied in previous labs

# prevent and expose the original SMB credential abuse attack path.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Attack Replay Summary

# The original attack chain from Lab 1 was replayed:

# \- Network authentication using previously abused credentials

# \- Attempted privileged access

# \- SMB-based remote execution technique

# 

# No new tools or techniques were introduced.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Detection Outcome

# 

# The following detection sequence was observed on the Windows Server (Wazuh agent):

# 

# 1\. \*\*Network logon detected (Type 3, NTLM/Negotiate)\*\*  

# &nbsp;  Indicates remote authentication over a network protocol consistent with SMB usage.

# 

# 2\. \*\*Privileged logon context assigned (Event 4672)\*\*  

# &nbsp;  Confirms the account received elevated privileges during the session.

# 

# 3\. \*\*New Windows service created (possible remote execution)\*\*  

# &nbsp;  Strong indicator of SMB-based remote execution (e.g. PsExec-style behavior).

# 

# This ordered sequence occurred within a short time window, providing high-confidence

# evidence of credential-based lateral movement activity.

# \## Comparison to Lab 1

# 

# | Aspect | Lab 1 | Lab 4 |

# |------|------|------|

# | Credential exposure | Present | Removed |

# | Visibility | Fragmented | Clear event chain |

# | Detection confidence | Low | High |

# | Analyst effort | Manual reconstruction | Direct timeline correlation |

#

# 

# \## Analyst Assessment

# 

# The detection logic correctly identified:

# \- The \*method\* of access (network logon)

# \- The \*impact\* of access (privileged context)

# \- The \*intent\* of access (remote execution)

# 

# No false positives required manual suppression during this test.

# 

# ---

# 

# \## Final Verdict

# 

# The original attack path is:

# \- \*\*Prevented\*\* at the configuration level

# \- \*\*Detectable\*\* at the behavioral level

# \- \*\*Explainable\*\* to analysts without protocol-level tuning

# 

# Lab 4 successfully validates the effectiveness of both remediation and detection engineering.
