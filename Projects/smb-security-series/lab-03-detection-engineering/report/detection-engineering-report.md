# \# Detection Engineering Report — SMB Credential Abuse

# 

# \## Summary

# Targeted detection rules were implemented to identify credential reuse and

# privileged remote execution on a Windows Server 2022 host.

# 

# \## Detection Logic

# Correlation of authentication, privilege assignment, and service creation events

# within a defined timeframe.

# 

# \## Outcome

# The attack scenario triggered a high-confidence alert without introducing

# significant noise.

# 

# \## Constraints

# Client-side credential exposure remained undetectable due to endpoint limitations.

# 

# \## Conclusion

# Detection engineering improved visibility of lateral movement while maintaining

# a realistic operational posture.
