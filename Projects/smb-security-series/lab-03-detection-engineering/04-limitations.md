# \## Limitations

# 

# \- Credential exposure on the SMB share host is not detectable due to OS limitations.

# \- Detection begins only after credentials are reused.

# \- Legitimate administrative activity may still generate similar signals.

# 

# These limitations are accepted and documented.
