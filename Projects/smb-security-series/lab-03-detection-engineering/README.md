# \# Lab 03 — Detection Engineering

# 

# This lab implements targeted detection for credential reuse and lateral movement

# using default Windows telemetry from a Windows Server 2022 host.

# 

# Due to endpoint limitations on the SMB share host (Windows 10 Home),

# detection engineering focuses exclusively on impact-side signals.
