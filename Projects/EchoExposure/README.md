# EchoExposure

### Overview
EchoExposure is an external attack-surface visibility tool that maps exposed infrastructure and services from an attacker’s perspective.
It focuses on what is visible, reachable, and misconfigured, without exploitation.

The tool is designed to answer one question precisely:
“What can the internet see right now?”
